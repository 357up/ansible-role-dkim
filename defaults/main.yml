# @TODO: Steal the variable style from https://github.com/MatthewMi11er/ansible-role-opendkim/blob/master/defaults/main.yml so the dkim_selector can be per domain.

dkim_milter_protocol: 6
dkim_selector: 'default'
dkim_milter_port: 12301
dkim_wildcard_sign_all_with_domain: ''
dkim_path_to_wildcard_key: '{{ path_to_wildcard_key| default("") }}'   # For backwards compatibility. The variable was originally named "path_to_wildcard_key"
dkim_report_recipient: '{{ admin_email | default("") }}'   # For backwards compatibility. The variable was originally named "admin_email"
